- **Core Dependencies**: 
  - pyevtx-rs (Rust-based EVTX parser)
  - elasticsearch (Elasticsearch client)
  - Click (CLI framework)
- **Package Manager**: pip/poetry
- **Development Tools**: pytest, black, mypy

## Domain-Specific Requirements

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize for large EVTX file processing
- Use streaming/chunked processing for memory efficiency
- Leverage Rust-based pyevtx-rs for maximum performance
- Implement progress reporting for long-running operations

### Elasticsearch Integration
- Support multiple Elasticsearch versions
- Implement proper index mapping for Windows Event Log fields
- Handle connection errors and retries gracefully
- Support bulk indexing for performance

### CLI Design
- Use Click for consistent command-line interface
- Provide clear progress indicators
- Support configuration files
- Implement proper error messages and help text

### Windows Event Log Specifics
- Handle various EVTX file formats correctly
- Preserve all relevant event metadata
- Support filtering and transformation of events
- Handle malformed or corrupted EVTX files gracefully

### Data Processing
- Implement proper JSON serialization for Elasticsearch
- Handle timestamp conversion and formatting
- Support custom field mapping and transformation
- Ensure data integrity during processing

## Development Workflow
- Focus on CLI usability and performance
- Test with real EVTX files of various sizes
- Benchmark performance improvements
- Document configuration options thoroughly
