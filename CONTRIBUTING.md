# Contributing to evtx2es

I am trying to make evtx2es better.  
For that I need your help.  

## Found a Bug?
If you find a bug in the source code, you can submit an issue or pull request to the repository.  

## Missing a Feature?
To request a new feature, submit an issue to the repository.  

However, I do not expect this tool to be able to do everything.  
I believe that evtx2es should exist as a small-scale utility, not as a large-scale application.  

## Development
1. Fork the this repository
2. Edit Source Codes
3. Push to the your forked repository
4. Create a new pull request

### Quickstart

```bash
$ git clone github.com/yourrepo/evtx2es
$ cd evtx2es

# create a python envs to working dir
$ pip install poetry
$ poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true

# install dependencies
$ poetry install

# ...edit source code...

# run program
$ poetry run python src/evtx2es.py -h
```

## Conclusion
Thank you for your interest in this project.  
I hope this tool will be useful to you.  

If you have any typos, refactorings, bad English in the readme (I'm really struggling with this), or anything else, I'd appreciate your help.  

Best regards.
